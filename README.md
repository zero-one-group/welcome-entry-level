## Background

### What is Zero One Group?

We provide an ecosystem of cutting-edge technological solutions to challenging business problems. We work with Indonesia's household enterprises such as [HokBen](https://www.hokben.co.id/) and well-established international institutions such as [Bloomberg Philantropies](https://www.bloomberg.org/). Apart from being deeply involved in the JS ecosystem with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), we also routinely use [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [Terraform](https://terraform.io) as part of our tech stack.

### A Remote-First Engineering Team

We are a 'remote-first' engineering team. It means that our default means of communications is asynchronous, which does not require the engineering team to be in the same place at the same time. An important implication of this is that engineers that are not based in Jakarta, where our main office is located, still get a first-class experience with Zero One Group. They never feel left out from important team discussions, and they don't miss out on unintentionally decisive water cooler conversations.

Currently, our remote engineering team consists of developers based in Greater Jakarta, Purbalingga, Kulon Progo, Surabaya, Malang and Makassar.

### Investing In Our Engineers

One of our co-founders, Didit, used to always say that he would like "to build a company **for engineers by engineers**". Indeed, we often claim that we are an engineering-first company, but what does it mean? At a high level, we want to optimise for engineers' comfort, productivity and growth. We would like to create a working environment where engineers can do their best work, make a real difference through software and be proud of their accomplishments. And all the while, they must also have the opportunity to explore new technologies and develop technically. We constantly invest in learning curriculums, career ladders, handbooks, mentoring schemes and other support systems so that we can be better at providing that working environment.

An unusual fact about Zero One Technology is that every founding member is or has been an engineer! We fully understand what it feels like to walk in the shoes of an engineer. We view the profession as a form craftsmanship - something that takes a lifetime to master. Thus, we respect the engineer as both a professional and an artist.

### Our Support for Open Source and Local Tech Ecosystems

Every engineer in Zero One Group is expected to contribute to open-source software at some point in their tenure. Here are some of the projects that we have initiated or actively contributed to:

- [Geni: A Clojure dataframe library that runs on Spark](https://github.com/zero-one-group/geni)
- [fxl: ƛ fxl.js is a data-oriented JavaScript spreadsheet library](https://github.com/zero-one-group/fxl.js)

## How to Apply

Please send your CV and/or portofolio to info@zero-one-group.com and cc doni@zero-one-group.com. Typically, the interview process consists of a technical interview, a general interview and a skill test.

**[⬆ back to top](#contents)**

## Interviewing at Zero One

### Interview Format

In a typical case, we require a skill test and two interview rounds - general and technical. The two interviews do not have a fixed order, but the skill test is typically sandwiched between the two interviews.

You should not need to prepare for the general interview round, as it should resemble a friendly chat about your life, hobbies, motivation, career goals, technical interests and past experiences. It is a way for us to get to know you better, and assess whether you would fit in well to the team we are hiring for. You should, however, prepare for the technical interview, as you will be tested not only on the depth, but also on the breadth of your knowledge. For that reason, be prepared to answer questions outside the area of your expertise!

Our skill test consists of a simple task in an area of expertise that you can choose, namely backend, web frontend, mobile or devops. Typically, the deadline of the skill test is set 72 hours after the test is sent to you. You may choose the day and time to start the test to fit your schedule!

### Tips and Advice

- Accept the calendar invitation, and turn up on time. We take punctuality and commitment very seriously.
- We also take deadlines very seriously. If you think you're not going to meet the skill test deadline, reach out to us early, and explain your situation. There is not much we can do if you tell us a few hours before the deadline!
- Speak freely and openly about your opinions and experience. We love genuine (though perhaps unusual) candidates!
- Be relaxed! Treat the interview as a casual conversation. There is no need to use formal languages such as 'Pak', 'Bu' or 'sebelumnya terima kasih, perkenalkan nama saya ...'. We are not that kind of company 😂
- If you don't know the answer to a question, it's better to say so, instead of guessing the answer. And do look it up after the interview - we may ask you the same question again!
- Read and learn widely. You are **not** expected to know everything about software development, but you should know a little bit about backend, web frontend, mobile and devops.
- We love personal projects, open-source contributions and online courses. If you are not asked about it in your interview, do proactively tell us about it!
